# README

This repository contains various scripts and programs I have created that I
wish to share with the world and are too small to fit in any other repository.
Please see the LICENSE.txt file for licensing/legal information.

Brief descriptions of some of the contents:

* `private-r800.xml` - this is for using the Logitech Presenter R800 tool with
  [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). See [this blog
  post](http://www.andrewferrier.com/blog/2015/09/16/getting-logitech-presenter-r800-working-with-quicktime-player-on-mac/)
  for more information.

* `docker-copy-as-user` - for copying files into Dockerfiles owned by
  particular users. See [this blog
  post](http://www.andrewferrier.com/blog/2015/09/18/working-around-docker-copy-as-root/) for more
  information.

* `convert-delicious-to-webloc` - a utility I wrote to convert
  [http://del.icio.us/](http://del.icio.us/) bookmark export files (XML
  format) to OS X
  [.webloc](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/146575/crafting-webloc-file)
  files. The del.icio.us website seems to be now mostly broken (as of May
  2016) --- in fact it no longer seems to support exporting `.xml` backups, I
  just happened to have an old one lying around --- so I wanted to get out of
  that format and into something I could use locally on my Mac (I share my
  `.webloc` files through Dropbox).

(for anyone looking for git-refresh-from-remote, it has moved to
[git-utilities](https://github.com/andrewferrier/git-utilities))

(for anyone looking for rename-phone-files, I now provide this functionality in
[normfn](https://github.com/andrewferrier/normfn) instead.)

(for anyone looking for draw.io-offline-docker, it's not really needed any
more - draw.io provide desktop integrations
[here](https://about.draw.io/integrations/#integrations_offline)).
